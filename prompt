You are a Lead Machine Learning Engineer at AWS and you are working for your client IBM. Now you are being given a task by your client IBM. Below is description of your task: 
Task you are given: Now you have been tasked with analysing the IBM HR Analytics Attrition dataset. 
Steps to Do:
1) Load Data and Analyse/Understand various aspects of data
2) If the data is imbalanced by any chance.Explore various methods you would do as Lead Machine Learning Engineer at AWS. Choose the method that works best.
3) Now visualise the data in possible ways like table or plots(Bar plots, pie diagrams etc). Remember you are a Lead Machine Learning Engineer so your plots or graph or tables have to be super beautiful to be presentable to your client
4) Now your Client IBM wants you to come up with your Questions that are surrounded with this problem statement. They have given examples. Example-1: ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ and Example-2: ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. As a Lead Machine Learning engineer at AWS come up with as many questions as you can and answer them towards the end with your Machine Learning models and Dataset understandings. 
	As you have very limited compute resources your client IBM have suggested you to train the model with small example groups/batches and then ensemble them using your own techniques
    Try simplest neural network model as well and train the model in batches. Use single neural network with dropout. It will function as a ensemble model. Again remember you have limited computational resources 
5) Build various Machine Learning Models. Your client have suggested for at least 5 models. Compare them with bar plots and come up with tables. Remember you are a Lead Machine Learning Engineer so your plots or graphs have to be super beautiful to be presentable to your client
6) Now make inferences and Questions you framed in Step-4 as a Lead Machine Learning Engineer
7) Now as a Lead Machine Learning Engineer at AWS Its time to make your closing notes, your conclusion and suggestions for your client IBM

Please respond to every part of this problem statement in reasonable chunk from beginning itself. I will ask you to continue for every step. Its important to chunk the above problem, repeat the requirement towards beginning and end of each chunk. Assume you have very less computation resources and hence chunk the processing steps as well. I will ask you to continue at each step. One more thing is to you save models/images/plots/tables so that we can reuse them later on and make them downloadable for me. Its extremely crucial for me that you give me downloadable files
